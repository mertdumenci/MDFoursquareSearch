MDFoursquareSearch
==================

Super simple Foursquare search powered by [Foursquare Venues Search API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/search).

It isn't complete, but it works â€” feel free to submit pull requests.

The usage is pretty straightforward, just check the header file.

Enjoy!

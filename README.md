# MDFoursquareSearch

MDFoursquareSearch is a super simple venue search API for iOS, powered by the [Foursquare Venues Search API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/search).

## Usage

All of MDFoursquareSearch's methods are directly invokable from the class.

**Coordinate-radius based search**
```objective-c
+(void)searchFoursquareForCoordinates:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coordinates radius:(NSInteger)radius withCompletionBlock:(FoursquareSearchCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[MDFoursquareSearch searchFoursquareForCoordinates:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(19, 24) 
					radius:300
					withCompletionBlock:^(NSArray *locations) {
					/*
						locations : 
							MDFoursquarePlace
							MDFoursquarePlace
							MDFoursquarePlace
							...
					*/
}];
```

**Coordinate-radius based search filtered by name**
```objective-c
+(void)searchFoursquareForCoordinates:(CLLocationCoordinate2D)coordinates radius:(NSInteger)radius forName:(NSString *)name withCompletionBlock:(FoursquareSearchCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[MDFoursquareSearch searchFoursquareForCoordinates:CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(19, 24) 
					radius:300
					forName:@"Starbucks"
					withCompletionBlock:^(NSArray *locations) {
					/*
						locations : 
							MDFoursquarePlace
							MDFoursquarePlace
							MDFoursquarePlace
							...
					*/
}];
```

**Name based search**
```objective-c
+(void)searchFoursquareForName:(NSString *)name withCompletionBlock:(FoursquareSearchCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[MDFoursquareSearch searchFoursquareForName:@"Starbucks" 
					withCompletionBlock:^(NSArray *locations) {
					/*
						locations : 
							MDFoursquarePlace
							MDFoursquarePlace
							MDFoursquarePlace
							...
					*/
}];
```
